# Certified Consulting Meteorologist (CCM)

What is the difference between the national exam for meteorologists in Japan and CCM in the U.S.?

- The Japanese Meteorologist Examination is a national qualification and is a business exclusive qualification. Specifically, this qualification is required in order to make and publish forecasts.  
- There are no qualifications for the Japanese Meteorologist Examination, and anyone can take the exam.  
- The Japanese meteorologist exam is not divided like the CCM and CBM exams in the U.S., and is more extensive.  

> To earn the CCM credential, a meteorologist must make application for the designation, be recommended by three associates, pass a stringent written examination, and pass an oral examination before a national board of examiners. The CCM designation is granted only to those who demonstrate a broad background in meteorology together with detailed knowledge in a particular field of specialization.
