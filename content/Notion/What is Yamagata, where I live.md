Yamagata, where I live, is said to be a sacred place for ramen.

The number of ramen stores in Yamagata is about three times that of the average in Japan.

Since there are so many stores, each store has a fierce battle, and I think the quality of taste is the number one in Japan.

  

Ramen in Tokyo is more expensive than Yamagata, but it's not tasty.
